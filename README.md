# Simple Todo App

The Simple ToDo App is a modular, scalable task-management application built as part of an advanced front-end engineering sprint.

The project demonstrates Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), component-driven architecture, and ES6 module design, focusing on clean, maintainable, and reusable code.

The app allows users to create tasks, assign optional due dates, mark items as completed, validate form inputs in real time, and remove tasks efficiently — all rendered dynamically using JavaScript DOM manipulation and HTML templates.

This project showcases production-quality practices and is suitable for real-world application or expansion.

## Functionality

- Create new tasks through a popup form, providing a name and optional due date
- Receive real-time form validation, including error messages and disabled submit buttons when inputs are invalid.
- View dynamically generated tasks, rendered from an HTML template and populated through the Todo class.
- Mark tasks as completed using an interactive checkbox that updates the task’s internal state.
- Delete tasks instantly through a dedicated delete button.
- View preloaded sample tasks, which are imported from a constants file and rendered on page load.

This project demonstrates real-world front-end engineering practices such as modular architecture, DOM cloning, reusable components, and controlled form submission.
